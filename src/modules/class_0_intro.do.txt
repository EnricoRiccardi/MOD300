===== Course objectives (second half) =====
!bblock
Understanding of

\pause

* Data sources and data properties
* Monte Carlo simulations
* Basis of machine learning
* modeling

!split
===== Metalearning =====

\pause

* Pedagogic empiricism teaches us that good learning happens in social contexts where the students are actively participating in the classroom dialogue
\pause
* In general, the number of questions, and the dialogue in general, drops significantly when lectures are recorded
\pause
* Remote atendance can lead to empty classrooms and higher failure rate.



!split
===== Teaching method =====
_!Active Learning!_

!bpop
* There will be a combination of lectures and tutorials.

* Tutorial and hands-on will be presented during the course.

* Study groups are strongly encouraged.

* In class discussions are encouraged at any stage.

* Flip classroom approach: problem first (when possible).

* Feedback expected from you!

* Note: each teacher, even if coordinated, will have a different approach/expectations.

LLMs can and shall be used in a \alert{production} phase . 
Their usage is encouraged, but they _DO_ hinder learning.

\pause

If you want to be a student (i.e. whom is learning), you shall take the responsibility in delivering original
output.

* Decisions are the hinge. What influences your decisions has value.

===== Hard and soft modeling =====

Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?). They can be wrong on porpouse!

!bblock Remember
Models are always wrong, but some are useful. (George Box)

!bpop
=== Three main families: ===
o Hard models (physics)
o Soft models (statistic)
o Machine learning
!epop

!split
===== Hard modeling =====
!bpop

* Based on an accurate physical description of the system and mathematical modeling (e.g. differential equations). Hard models are often deterministic.

* Hard modeling methods usually use optimization methods to find out the best values for the parameters of the model.

* Hard modeling is preferable in laboratory experiments, where all the variables are controlled and the physicochemical nature of the dynamic model is known and can be fully described using a known mathematical model.

* Hard modeling, if successful, usually gives better understanding of a system and better extrapolations. Wrong assumptions often lead to non-sense results.
!epop

!split
===== Soft modeling =====

!bpop
* Soft-modeling describes systems without the need of an *a priori* physical or (bio)chemical model postulation. They are _data driven_ models.

* Soft models are much easier to make than hard models.

* Soft modeling can be used to understand complex relationships.

* Soft modeling needs (much) more data than hard-modeling.

* Soft models have a poor extrapolating capabilities (compared with hard-modeling)
!epop


!split
===== How to create hard models? =====
After understanding the problem to be solved we need to:

o Link mathematics to physics.
o Define boundary conditions and constitutive equations.
o Make tons of assumptions.
o Solve the constitutive equation in space and time.
o Check solution stability and sensitivity analysis.
o A long set of judicious approximations have to be taken.
o It is hard (but we are engineers!).
o Get quite some money for the awesome job.


!split
===== How to create soft models? =====

After understanding the general problem to be solved we need to:

* Determine a suitable _numerical description_ .
* Choose a suitable _model_ to which parameters are fitted.
* Train, test, validate the model.
* Perform _data analysis_ with chosen method(s).
* Link predictions with expectations.

===== Uncertainty or Probability? =====

Our aim here is to provide good guidance on how to link data, models and output to value creation.

!bpop
* First we need to understand uncertainty and probability, and the difference between the two.

!bblock
* Spoiler: Probability is the language of uncertainty!
!eblock

\vspace{1em}

* We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainty.

* Clarity of language in probability is one of the hallmarks of decision analysis and of modeling.

!split
===== Data properties (i.e. statistics!) =====

* All starts from data: what are data-properties?

!bpop
* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Life lesson (or exam question, same thing ;) )
